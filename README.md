# JavaScript Interview Questions – Day 2 💡

This repository contains my Day 2 practice of JavaScript Interview Questions as part of my ongoing training journey.  
Under the guidance of [#LakhwindarSir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakhwindarsir/), I focused on strengthening core concepts through hands-on coding.

## 📘 Topics Covered

On **Day 2**, I practiced and revised the following important JavaScript concepts:

- ✅ `typeof` operator
- ✅ Difference between `==` vs `===`
- ✅ Use of `isNaN()` and how it behaves with different inputs
- ✅ Concept of `undefined`, `null`, and `NaN`
- ✅ Scope in JavaScript: Local, Block, Functional
- ✅ Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- ✅ Use of `Set` and `Map` under Object concepts
- ✅ Vowel counting in a string using loop
- ✅ Array-related questions with logic building
